<!-- Need a tag with the id 'bzcount'. The tag should be a text display tag (p, 
b, h1, etc.), since any tag within the bzcount tag will be replaced with the number
of views. 
If you don't want to display page views, don't include an id of 'bzcount', 
however all the javascript files need to be included regardless. -->
<p id='bzcount'>
</p>

<!-- Include the required javascript packages, as well as the javascript
file itself -->
<!-- socket.io has a wierd way of hiding its client javascript file. It can be located
at node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/socket.io-client/dist/socket.io.js, but the
src can be changed to wherever socket.io.js is. -->
