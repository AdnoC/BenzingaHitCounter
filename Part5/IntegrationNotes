CounterServer.js is the entry point for the counter.
app.js is the entry point for the actual app.
Use routes.js to require the counter and set up Express routing.
Still need to add verification before showing veiw counter in page_view.
Change CounterServer and IndividualServer to simplify increments, if possible.
jquery-cookie-master will need to be moved to the server, and page_view editted to 
    reflect the move, or something could be added to routes (not sure if will work).
